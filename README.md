# Gatsby / Next Research Hackathon

So far we have mainly use `create-react-app` to help us build react apps. `create-react-app` sets out some boiler plate code and give us a development server, and the rest is up to us. Both Gatsby and Next do more behind the scenes to help you make the best application you can, but they are subtly different. Gatsby is a "static site generator", while next does "server-side rendering". What do these mean? That's what you are going to find out.

## Task

Build an app in either Gatsby or Next, decided by the code below:

```js
if (roomNumber % 2 === 0) {
  console.log("You are doing gatsby");
} else {
  console.log("you are doing next");
}
```

Research what it is that it does well.

Your site should have...

- Multiple pages
  - That you can navigate between
  - One of which fetches data from an api
  - One of which is interactive and stateful

You should research...

- What makes your option different from Create React App
- What use cases there are for your option

## Result

At the end of the day you will pair up with another team that did the other option. Share the knowledge you've picked up and understand what the other team has learned.

## Links

Here are some starters, but make sure to do your own research too!

### Helpful Hints

* Don't just jump straight into this, learn about your framework FIRST
* You only have a day, so remember to scale your plan accordingly
* We have deliberately not set up any starter code, as there are two possible setups
* TDD can be helpful
* remember the 15/15 rule - 15 mins discussing in your team, 15 mins searching online, and then ask for help

### When Asking For Help

Please post all requests in the Help Dev channel, along with

* Room Number
* A description of the problem
* Code / error message (where relevant)
* What you've tried already
